**Describe the bug**
The language switch doesn't work well, when you select profile->Italiano-> and try to select english from the dropdown, it doesn't work. Right after you press Italiano to get the dropdown menu and move your cursor, the dropdown menu disappears. 
The notification icon doesn't work at all. Whenever pressed, the screen greys out like there's an overlay but there's no popup window or anything similar and becomes useless until reloaded again
Also the font size and the overall menu is very small than our original portal which is very inconvenient. There's so much space at the bottom and the overall UI is very compact and smaller for convenience



**Expected behavior**
The dropdown menu is expected to stay until an option is selected
The notification icon is expected to show notifications as a popup window
Enlarge the menus and the font size, it's okay to have a bigger page with scroll than a very compact that needs a magnifier
